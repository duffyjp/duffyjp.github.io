# 123456.base_52

This week I needed to encode a number in a minimum of URL safe characters.  
I started with Ruby's built in `to_s(36)` which was pretty reasonable, 
until you run into user accounts translating directly into bad words.  I'm looking at you 13996.

I decided to write my own with numbers and both cases of letters but no vowels.  That leaves 52 characters.

Monkey patching isn't in vogue anymore, but I like it for this kind of stuff.

```ruby
class Integer
  # No vowels means no naughty words.  Radix: 52
  # You can't do negative, that's not what this is for.
  # See also String.base_52
  def base_52
    alphabet = %w(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 b c d f g h j k l m n p q r s t v w x y z B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Y Z)
    integer = self.abs
    string  = []
    loop do
      string << alphabet[integer % 52]
      (integer/=52).nonzero? || break
    end
    string.reverse.join
  end
end
```

```ruby
class String
  # No vowels means no naughty words.  Radix: 52
  # See also Integer.base_52
  def base_52
    alphabet = %w(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 b c d f g h j k l m n p q r s t v w x y z B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Y Z)
    self.chars.reverse.each_with_index.map{ |char, index| alphabet.find_index(char) * 52 ** index }.sum
  rescue
    nil
  end
end
```


It works pretty well, although I'm not totally happy with the complexity of the Integer version. 
If you try to use a String with an invalid character it just returns nil.

```ruby
123456.base_52
 => "SF8" 
"SF8".base_52
 => 123456 
 ```
